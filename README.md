# Suspension_System
## Designing the tire 
For installation of the tire in the following Foot part, it is necessary to designate a specific tire with a specific dimension. The SolidWorks program has been used to create the tire with its dimensions.

## Designing The Suspension part and Designing the tire 
A suspension system is a protective lattice of shock-absorbing components. By absorbing the energy of road bumps and other kinetic impacts, the suspension helps ensure the robot's safety and smooth operation. Also, increasing tire friction, it helps keep your tires on the road. As a result of the importance of the suspension system and its impact, the following design has been chosen.

## Bearing  
Bearings reduce friction among moving parts and limit relative motion to the desired motion. In some bearing designs, the moving part may be allowed to move linearly or rotate freely around a fixed axis. The following bearing and supporter are used to connect the tire to the foot.

## Connect the System
After collecting the parts of the tire, a suitable hole has been introduced to the foot. and this is the final design of the system
